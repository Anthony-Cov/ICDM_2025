# Optimisation of a socio-economic system for increasing residents' satisfaction level<BR>

It is obvious that the problem of client migration in various businesses like banks, mobile operators and so on; the problem of user preferences’ shift from one social network or computer game to another; or the problem of people’s migration between cities and countries all have their roots in satisfaction and happiness provided by services or life conditions. The matching of these to human values, necessities, and identities makes a certain business or settlement successful and attractive. This task looks like an optimisation one. Optimisation tasks can be easily solved with a good deal of well-known algorithms. The only trouble in our case is the objective function, whose optimal value should be found. The ideal goal for optimisation should be satisfying clients' or residents' needs in various aspects of their life according to their customs, habits, values and identities, which is hard to measure and digitalise, like many things in the human world. In our research, we attempt to solve this task by means of cluster analysis for features discovery and determine the attractive business strategy or directions for development.<BR>
